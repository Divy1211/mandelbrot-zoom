# Mandelbrot Zoom
1. I have coded a Mandelbrot set Zoom renderer in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. If you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisites
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works

1. This program implements the Mandelbrot zoom. It uses the same mathematical formula explained in depth [here](https://github.com/Divy1211/Mandelbrot).
2. The `aa` variable in the program controls the anti aliasing level. Note that increasing the canvas size or AA levels will significantly increase rendering times!
